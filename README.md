# future_keyboard
a project im working on rn. a keyboard that can listen/talk to you, can read your hands and can do things such as changing the volume/scroll/move the mouse. this code is still in process. the whole keyboard will be on a touch screen/mechanical design i have in mind. the screen will be full HD and the keyboard will be supper customizable. we will add at 1 point AI assistent that will help the user. and understand what he is going to write and then it can auto correct perfectly and it can write for you, the AI will also understand your voice better and then the user will be able to use a normal good working speech to text.
our goal is to reach a higher level then the flux keyboard - a keyboard with alot of functions and also on a screen but its not that technology. it doesnt have AI/voice/cam
