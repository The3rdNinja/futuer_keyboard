# futuer_keyboard
a project im working on rn. a keyboard that can listen/talk to you, can read your hands and can do things such as changing the volume/scroll/move the mouse. this code is still in process. the whole keyboard will be on a touch screen/mechanical design i have in mind. the screen will be full HD and the keyboard will be supper customizable.
